# Recipe.collab

Currently a temporary name, recipe.collab is a work-in-progress recipe site that lets you collaboratively build recipes by cloning others and collaboratively working on them. Built with the PERN stack, in its final form it will be a fullstack application serving users.


At the moment Recipe.collab is very early in development there is no documentation as it is not in a running state. This readme will be updated as progress is made.
